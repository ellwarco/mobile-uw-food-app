      "description" : "Husky Grind is about more than providing a quality cup of coffee. We develop our flavor profiles by small-batch roasting on campus, and the rest of our beans are prepared locally by Seven Coffee Roasters. Origin cards let you know exactly where our beans come from including the country, farm, exporter and certifications. Single-origin practices follow the traditions of specialty brewers, letting you experience the character and subtleties in a particular region's crop. So drop in and warm up at your friendly neighborhood Husky Grind. Husky Grind also partners with design and agricultural programs on campus for coffee-related special events and seminars. You'll find Husky Grind coffee at Husky Grind Café in Mercer Court as well as District Market in Alder Hall and Parnassus in the Art Building.",
